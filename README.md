# weather-insight-lab
A NumPy and Matplotlib- powered project for analyzing 30 day weather trends across multiple cities.
Includes statistical summaries, labeled heat waves and cold snaps and visual insights using data visualization.

# Objective:
1. Generate synthetic temperature data for multiple cities using NumPy
2. Analyze weather patterns such as average, minimum, maximum and standard deviation per city.
3. Label days as 'Heat Wave', 'Cold Snap', or Normal using NumPy operations.
4. Evaluate which cities experienced the most weather variability.
5. Visualize temperature trends over a 30 day period using Matplotlib
6. Save and load numerical and labeled data using .csv formats.

# Tools Used:
-Python 3.10+ - core programming language used for data processing and analysis.
-NumPy - efficient handling of large arrays and vectorized computations for temperature data.
-Matplotlib - line plots showing daily temperature changes across cities for fast, intuitive interpretation.
-Jupyter - Development Environment for writing and testing the analysis
- CSV - formats for storing and reloading temperature data and labeled outputs

# Key Insights:
Billboards show a moderate impact on sales with a correlation of 0.48 and an r_squared of 0.23 meaning 23% of sales variation is explained by its spend.
Affiliate marketing had the strongest explanatory power with a correlation of 0.61 and r_squared value of 0.37 while influencer marketing had the weakest.
